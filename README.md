## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- React

- Tailwind CSS

To this project, I've decided not to use any lib to handle form, to practice doing so purely with React and TS;

The template was provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ) and some decisions were made by myself aiming to improve user's experience.
